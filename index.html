    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) are basically super smart computer programs that are getting really
        good at
        handling tasks that used to be handled by humans, Artificial Intelligence is now making its way into
        our
        day

                    AI is being used to develop self-driving cars, which have the potential to <em>revolutionize
                        transportation.</em> Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors, such as cameras and radar,
                    to
                    perceive their surroundings. AI algorithms and neural networks use this information to make
                    human-like predictions for the car.

            <h2>Disadvantages Of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
            <p>
                Listed below are some of the disadvantages of AI.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Job Displacement:</em> A major concern surrounding AI is its impact on the job market. As AI
                    automates tasks and processes, repetitive jobs are particularly at risk. This could lead to
                    widespread unemployment, requiring workforce retraining and adaptation to new job landscapes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Ethical dilemmas:</em> AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets, and these datasets can
                    reflect societal biases. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas like loan approvals
                    or recruitment. Ensuring fairness and ethical implementation of AI requires careful
                    consideration and development of robust guidelines

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, AI is a powerful tool with immense potential. However, it's crucial to acknowledge and
                address its potential drawbacks. By fostering responsible development, ethical considerations, and
                human-AI collaboration, we can leverage the advantages of AI while mitigating its risks.
